       "Hermeneutical injustice is a wrong done to a social group by the fact that their culture's shared hermeneutical resources are skewed towards the experiences of its more powerful members, resulting in harm to the less powerful group. It is characterized by three criteria: (a) the culture lacks the appropriate meanings to understand (some aspect of) the experience of the less powerful group; (b) the less powerful group is harmed by this lack of meanings; and (c) the lack of meanings is due to the fact that the social group to which they belong is hermeneutically marginalized. This marginalization is usually the result of uneven distributions of power, and the harm caused by hermeneutical injustice is not merely bad luck, but an actual injustice. An example of this is when someone suffers from a mystery illness, but their culture lacks the concepts to properly understand their situation, resulting in them not receiving appropriate medical care. In such cases, individuals may attempt to circumvent the lack of hermeneutical resources by engaging in collective consciousness-raising exercises, such as speak-outs, which can introduce new hermeneutical resources that better reflect their lived experience. This can provide them with a handle on their experiences of which they had previously been deprived.</b>"

       "Hermeneutical injustice is related to a phenomenon where the meaning of concepts are twisted and co-opted, eventually losing their meaning in that oppressive and distorting concepts can be used to crowd out, defeat, or preempt the accurate application of a concept. Examples of such oppressive concepts include the use of genocidal language games (Tirrell, 2012) and rape myths in the news media (O’Hara, 2012), which both have been used to distort the meaning of concepts and prevent the accurate application of those concepts. Positive hermeneutical injustice is thus connected to the presence of oppressive concepts that limit or block the accurate application of a concept, as well as the removal of available hermeneutical resources, such as postracial movements which attempt to erase the concept of race and thereby limit or block the accurate application of the concept (Paiella, 2016). \n",

       "This can result in a failure of conceptual aptness or applicability, meaning that marginalized individuals are unable to contribute their knowledge in a socially significant context and their status as a knower is diminished (Pohlhaus, 2012; Toole, 2019). Combating hermeneutical injustice is therefore not just a matter of filling in hermeneutical gaps, but also involves large-scale social movements aimed at dismantling oppressive ideologies and scripts. Such movements are necessary in order to develop and widely disseminate novel concepts needed to understand socially significant experiences (Rowe, 1974; Taylor, 2018), as well as to unlearning and dislodging the distorting ideological grip of controlling images and oppressive concepts that are operative within one’s social milieu (Yap, 2017). Examples of such movements include the gay rights movement and the fight for marriage equality in North America (Eleonore, 2019), as well as the #BodyPositivity movement (Park, 2017; Shackelford, 2019), which have helped to support the intelligibility of concepts that have been twisted and co-opted, and have also enabled individuals to enjoy benefits and privileges afforded by legal unions (White, 1983; Xu, 2016).</b>"

       "Response(response='The original answer is still relevant and provides a good overview of how hermeneutical injustice can result from the co-opting and twisting of concepts. However, let\\'s add some more context to illustrate the connection between the two phenomena.\\n\\nWhen concepts are co-opted and twisted, it can result in a loss of meaning and understanding, which can perpetuate hermeneutical injustice. Hermeneutical injustice occurs when a person or group is unable to fully express their experiences and meanings due to a lack of shared understanding or language. This can result in the marginalization and silencing of certain groups.\\n\\nFor example, the concept of \"equality\" has been co-opted by some to mean simply treating everyone the same, rather than addressing systemic inequalities and power imbalances. This can result in hermeneutical injustice for marginalized groups who are disproportionately affected by these inequalities, as their experiences and struggles are not being fully recognized or addressed within the concept of \"equality.\"\\n\\nSimilarly, the co-opting of the concept of \"diversity\" can perpetuate hermeneutical injustice for marginalized groups. When diversity is reduced to a superficial representation of different backgrounds, it fails to address systemic inequalities and power imbalances that prevent marginalized groups from thriving. This can result in a lack of understanding and misrepresentation of the experiences and struggles of these groups, perpetuating the marginalization and silencing of their voices.\\n\\nOverall, the co-opting and twisting of concepts can lead to a loss of meaning and understanding, perpetuating hermeneutical injustice for marginalized groups.

       "<b>The phenomenon of distorting and co-opting concepts, eventually leading to their loss of meaning, can contribute to the persistence of hermeneutical injustice. Hermeneutical injustice occurs when there is a lacuna in the collective hermeneutical repertoire resulting from one's hermeneutical marginalization, or when there is a failure of conceptual application or aptness due to the presence of distorting and oppressive concepts. When concepts are integrated into preexisting hermeneutical frameworks containing negative controlling images and oppressive distorting concepts, they have the potential to crowd out, defeat, or preempt the application of an available and more accurate hermeneutical resource. This can restrict the productive function and power of liberatory concepts, resulting in various injustices, including the systematic exclusion of certain groups from participating in the collective interpretation of their experiences, perpetuation of oppressive social arrangements, and the normalization and justification of such arrangements.\n",
       "\n",
       "To overcome hermeneutical injustice, it is not enough to simply introduce a hermeneutical resource that fills a lacuna in the collective understanding. Hermeneutical justice requires collective social movements aimed at disrupting and reforming dominant conceptual frameworks and social scripts. This involves cultivating and propagating novel conceptual resources and dislodging the distorting ideological grip of controlling images and oppressive concepts that are operative within one's social milieu. Successfully challenging and disrupting the status quo narrative requires dislodging ingrained assumptions and ideologies that normalize and purport to justify oppressive social arrangements.

Hermeneutical Justice\\nWhat might it take to overcome hermeneutical injustice? Here I will begin to sketch apath forward. A more expansive framework suggests that hermeneutical justice requires\\nmore than filling in hermeneutical lacunae. More plausibly, combating hermeneutical\\ninjustice demands collective social movements aimed at disrupting and reforming dom-\\ninant conceptual frameworks and social scripts. Hence, it ’s not only important to\\ndevelop and widely disseminate novel concepts needed to understand socially signifi-\\ncant experiences. But equally (if not more) important is unlearning and dislodging\\nthe distorting ideological grip of controlling images and oppressive concepts that are\\noperative within one ’s social milieu.\\nThis is unlikely to be effective if done piecemeal, individual by individual, concept by\\nconcept. Instead, hermeneutical justice is more likely to be achieved with collective\\nsocial action —movements that center the voices and experiences of marginalized indi-\\nviduals and that aim to disrupt and expose systemic patterns of oppression and exploi-\\ntation.\\n19We can look to the gay rights movement and the fight for marriage equality in\\nNorth America as an illustrative example. The concept marriage is now (to a great\\nextent) routinely applied to gay couples in social and legal contexts. This movement\\nhelped to support the intelligibility of gay marriage, but additionally, it enabled gay cou-\\nples to enjoy benefits and privileges afforded by legal unions (for example, health insur-ance benefits, immigration and residency benefits, Social Security', doc_id='b6cfd999-7a4d-4e06-819a-0d848907e76c', embedding=None, doc_hash='648070f7b33aa238a0f7307e67f0444af54f536b22470d84789db20866d9ee94', extra_info={'filename': '..\\\\..\\\\papers\\\\For_Imposter_Concept_Paper\\\\hermeneutical-injustice-distortion-and-conceptual-aptness.pdf'}, node_info={'start': 64644, 'end': 68488}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'e27d1a05-defb-4475-849a-5c6752c1b29a'}), score=0.9201984798050473)\n",
      "NodeWithScore(node=Node(text='injustice. Conceptual competence does not\\nensure the accurate application of a concept, especially in high-stakes social contexts\\nwhere privileged groups stand to gain from conceptual distortion and oppressive ideo-\\nlogical practices. The application of the needed concept may be defeated or preempted\\nwhen pernicious background ideologies and social practices dictate that some other\\nopposing and distorting concept is more applicable. Hence, even if the concept is avail-\\nable and widely used across social groups and communities, this is not enough to secureits accurate application, and importantly, not enough to reap the productive value of the\\nconcept in important social contexts.\\nLet’s take stock. So far, I have outlined the productive function and power of herme-\\nneutical resources —how they serve to organize members of society and how some dis-\\ntorting concepts or controlling images purport to justify and normalize unjust social\\narrangements. This drew our attention to an important, yet often overlooked, value\\nof hermeneutical resources, namely, their productive value and potential to support\\nsocial and political change. Thus, the value of hermeneutical resources is at least two-\\nfold: they have productive as well as interpretive value. Recognizing this, in turn, helped\\nto uncover a species of hermeneutical injustice that does not result from a hermeneu-\\ntical lack. Reflecting upon concrete examples of hermeneutical injustice without lacunae\\nmade highlighted a critical need to consider how concepts are operationalized within a\\ngiven social milieu —how they combine with other extant concepts and how they are\\nintegrated into preexisting hermeneutical frameworks. The need for this is especially\\npressing when extant hermeneutical frameworks contain negative controlling images\\nand oppressive distorting concepts. Such concepts have the potential to crowd out,\\ndefeat, or preempt the application of an available and more accurate hermeneutical\\nresource.\\nIn the next section, I begin to develop a more expansive and more socially situated\\nframework for theorizing about hermeneutical injustice. This approach aims to accom-\\nmodate cases of hermeneutical injustice both with and without hermeneutical gaps.\\nV. A More Expansive Framework: Positive and Negative Hermeneutical Injustice\\nWhy do the cases described thus far capture a distinct species of hermeneutical injus-\\ntice? Recall that according to Fricker the primary harm of hermeneutical injustice “con-\\nsists in a situated hermeneutical inequality : the concrete situation is such that the\\nsubject is rendered unable to make communicatively intelligible something which it\\nis particularly in his or her interests to be able to render intelligible ”(Fricker 2007 ,\\n162). We can break down Fricker ’s analysis more precisely as requiring the following\\nnecessary conditions. Hermeneutical injustice occurs when: (i) one ’s experience fails\\nto be intelligible (either to oneself or to others), (ii) the hermeneutical tools needed\\nto make one ’s experience intelligible are not collectively shared by those in the relevant\\nsocial context, and (iii) this is due to a lacuna in the collective hermeneutical repertoire\\nresulting from one ’s hermeneutical marginalization.\\nConsider the perspective of Chanel Miller, the survivor in the Turner case. Miller\\nwas clearly in a position to render her experience intelligible —she wasn ’t hindered in\\nher ability to understand that she was a victim of rape. This was unmistakably and pain-\\nfully obvious to her. Others, however, were reluctant, or altogether failed, to apply the\\nconcept rapist to Turner. This, of course, is not to say that such individuals lacked the\\nconcept rapist ; this concept was available and intelligible to them.', doc_id='72abf306-a8d4-418a-92a1-850892f941d9', embedding=None, doc_hash='e0fa545314c67d9db9f86a3ef112faa54b9ea3d3172f4a9767aa6826b4568490', extra_info={'filename': '..\\\\..\\\\papers\\\\For_Imposter_Concept_Paper\\\\hermeneutical-injustice-distortion-and-conceptual-aptness.pdf'}, node_info={'start': 45957, 'end': 49713}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'e27d1a05-defb-4475-849a-5c6752c1b29a'}), score=0.9196376256538776)\n"

       "Response(response='The concept of hermeneutical injustice is related to a phenomenon where the meaning of concepts are twisted and co-opted, eventually losing their meaning by sustaining and promoting pernicious background ideologies and unjust social arrangements. This can happen in various ways, such as through eliciting inappropriate inferences or analogies, as outlined by Ishani Maitra. The distortion of concepts contributes to the restriction of the productive function and power of liberatory concepts, both old and new, and requires large-scale social movements aimed at dismantling oppressive ideologies and social practices. Filling in hermeneutical gaps is just one part of a much broader, comprehensive, and socially embedded process to guard against and overcome the harms of hermeneutical injustice. However, a lacuna-centered framework proposes that hermeneutical injustice stems from one\\'s inability to make a significant social experience intelligible owing to a gap in the stock of hermeneutical resources, where this gap is a result of hermeneutical marginalization. According to this approach, hermeneutical injustice is perpetuated by the persistence and/or cultivation of hermeneutical lacunae, and hermeneutical justice calls for hermeneutical \"plugs\" to fill in the gaps. Therefore, the lacuna-centered framework highlights a different way for hermeneutical gaps to emerge, which feature prominently in analyzing hermeneutical injustice.', source_nodes=[NodeWithScore(node=Node(text='benefits, immigration and residency benefits, Social Security programs, and so on).\\nHaving marriage readily apply to gay couples was productively powerful —it helped to\\nimprove the material conditions of many gay couples across North America.\\nAnother example is the #BodyPositivity movement, which has gained a global online\\nfollowing over the past decade (Baker 2015 ; Crabbe 2017 ; Taylor 2018 ). The overarching\\nmission of this movement is to combat mainstream narratives that promote unhealthy\\nand downright unattainable standards of beauty, body image, and health, targeting pri-marily young women and girls. By centering bodies that are marginalized in main-\\nstream media —disabled bodies, fat bodies, and bodies of color —and with slogans\\nlike “‘Fat’is not a bad word ”(Shackelford 2019 ) and artists like Cinta Tort Cartró\\nwho embraces the beauty of stretch marks by painting them vibrant colors (Park\\n2017 ), this movement aims to problematize dominant social assumptions and narratives\\nthat deem fatness and other marginalized body features to be a cause for embarrass-\\nment, shame, or inferiority.\\n20\\nCombating hermeneutical injustice is thus not simply a matter of filling in\\nhermeneutical gaps. Hermeneutical justice demands something much more radical andfar-reaching. More plausibly, it demands large-scale social movements aimed at disman-\\ntling oppressive ideologies and social practices. Without question, part of this will involve\\ncultivating and propagating novel conceptual resources —for example, concepts like gen-\\nderqueer, disability pride, body positivity, andsexual harassment —that is, it will require\\nfilling in hermeneutical lacunae. But, as we ’ve seen, much more is needed beyond this\\nto sufficiently guard against and overcome the harms of hermeneutical injustice.Hypatia 357\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\nSo, where does this leave us? In closing, I want to emphasize what I take to be the\\nbest way forward in theorizing about hermeneutical injustice and epistemic injustice\\nmore broadly. The main thrust is this: we need to broaden our horizons and engage\\nin a more socially embedded way.21Contrasting cases of positive and negative herme-\\nneutical injustice serves to illustrate how concepts don ’t exist and operate independently\\nfrom each other, but are deeply interconnected. The productive value of hermeneutical\\ntools is both constrained and enabled by their place alongside other concepts within anoverarching social milieu. Moreover, the sheer fact that many concepts were and still are\\nneeded to make sense of the socially significant experiences of marginalized communi-\\nties should be extremely suggestive of the current state of collective hermeneutical\\nframeworks and the strong influence of unjust social practices and oppressive concepts\\nand controlling images therein.\\nIt is thus imperative that we pay close attention to how concepts can function to\\nsustain and promote pernicious background ideologies and unjust social arrangements,\\nand how this in turn can restrict the productive function and power of liberatory\\nconcepts, both old and new.

For simplicity, and following much of the literature, I will talk mostly in terms of conceptual\\nresources.358 Arianna Falbo\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\n2This requirement is argued for in Fricker 2006 ;2007 ;2016 ; and 2017. Although much of Fricker ’s orig-\\ninal 2007 discussion frames hermeneutical injustice as centrally involving hermeneutical lacunae, it ’s nota-\\nble that she includes the example of Edmund White ’sA Boy ’s Own Story (White 1983 ). This is a\\nsemi-autobiographical novel that describe White ’s experiences in the 1950s as a gay young man battling\\ndominant stereotypes of homosexuality as unnatural or as a sickness. Thus, Fricker ’s discussion of herme-\\nneutical injustice is sensitive to how oppressive stereotypes —and not just conceptual gaps —can influence\\nhermeneutical injustice, yet she remains focused largely upon lacunae throughout her discussion (see, espe-\\ncially, Fricker 2007 , 161 –62, as well as the initial definition of hermeneutical injustice given at the start of\\nher book: “hermeneutical injustice occurs . . . when a gap in collective resources puts someone at an unfair\\ndisadvantage when it comes to making sense of their social experiences ”[1]).\\n3This requirement for hermeneutical injustice is adopted widely across recent literature. See, for example,\\nBeeby 2011 ; Medina 2011 ,2012 ; Dotson 2012 ; Dotson 2014 ; Anderson 2017 ; Goetze 2017 ; Medina 2017 ;\\nToole 2019 ; Vasilyeva and Ayala-López 2019 ; Beverley 2020 ; Dembroff 2020 ; Dembroff and Whitcomb\\nforthcoming .\\n4Thank you to an anonymous referee for suggesting this terminology.\\n5Fricker draws from Susan Brownmiller ’s memoir of the Women ’s Liberation Movement in the 1960s\\nwhen discussing the case of Carmita Wood (Brownmiller 1990 ). For other early uses of the concept sexual\\nharassment , see Rowe 1974 ; Nemy 1975 .\\n6Criticisms of Fricker ’s analysis of hermeneutical injustice have pointed out a failure to distinguish\\nbetween intra and intercommunal dissemination of hermeneutical resources. See, for example, Mason\\n2011 ; Medina 2012 ; 2013. It is worth noting that even the inter/intracommunal dissemination distinction\\nis fairly idealized. The boundaries here are likley not as crisp as this distinction might suggest. For a relateddiscussion, also see Ashley Atkins ’s distinction between resistant understanding and dominant or collective\\nunderstanding (Atkins 2018 ).\\n7In developing her analysis of controlling images, Collins cites the work of Mae King and Cheryl Gilkes\\n(King 1973 ; Gilkes 1981 ). In discussing the work of these two scholars, Collins notes:\\nKing suggests that stereotypes represent externally-defined, controlling images of Afro-American\\nwomanhood that have been central to the dehumanization of Black women and the exploitation\\nof Black women ’s labor. Gilkes points out that Black women ’s assertiveness in resisting the multifac-\\neted oppression they experience has been a consistent threat to the status quo. As punishment, Black\\nwomen have been assaulted with a variety of externally-defined negative images designed to controlassertive Black female behavior. The value of King ’s and Gilkes ’analyses lies in their emphasis on the\\nfunction of stereotypes in controlling dominated groups. (Collins 1986 , 17, italics added)\\n8Note: as was mentioned previously, this does not necessarily mean that Black women are unable to\\ndevelop and use hermeneutic resources intra communally.\\n9We can also compare similar influential rhetoric during World War II that described Jewish people as\\n“vermin. ”For example, this language is prevalent in The Eternal Jew , a 1940 Nazi propaganda film. For\\nfurther discussions on the productive function of pernicious social concepts see, for example, Young\\n1990 , chapter 2, on cultural imperialism, Kukla 2018 on the relationship between slurs and ideology,\\nand Neufeld 2019 on slurs and essentialization.\\n10It is also important to note that “monstrosity ”and “animality ”are also deeply racialized notions in a\\nUnited States context, associated primarily with Black people and people of color. Consider, for example,\\nthe rhetoric surrounding the 1989 “Central Park Five ”case where five Black teenagers were wrongfully\\naccused of raping a white woman who was jogging in Central Park. These boys were described as a\\n“wolf pack, ”“animals, ”“bloodthirsty, ”“savages, ”and “wilding ”(Hinton 2019 ).\\n11At the time of the trial, the victim ’s name was kept anonymous and listed under “Emily Doe. ”However,\\nChanel Miller has recently shared her story with the broader public in a memoir: Know My Name (Miller\\n2019\\n).\\n12Manne ’s discussion of the Brock Turner case engages primarily with Fricker ’s account of testimonial\\ninjustice, a kind of epistemic injustice wherein a testifier ’s report fails to gain uptake owing to an identity\\nprejudice that the testimonial recipient has against the testifier. It ’s noteworthy that Fricker focuses primar-\\nily upon credibility deficits when developing her analysis of testimonial injustice (that is, giving too littleHypatia 359\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\ncredit to a testifier because of an identity prejudice that one has against them) (Fricker 2007 ). However,\\nrecent scholarship has persuasively argued that credibility surpluses —giving a testifier too much credit\\nowing to some prejudice —can also perpetuate testimonial injustice. See Medina 2012; Davis 2016 ;Y a p\\n2017 ; and Lackey 2018 ;2020 for further defenses of this point.\\n13Parts of this passage are quoted and discussed in Manne 2020 , 38. See Manne 2020 , chapter 3, for an\\ninsightful further discussion of this case.\\n14Another telling example concerns how Muslim men who commit violent acts against civilians are rou-\\ntinely labeled terrorists across United States media channels. But, when non-Muslim, white men commit\\nnearly identical acts, their behavior is routinely attributed to nonessential features of their psychology(for example, mental illness) or exogenous features of their environment (for example, poor childhood\\nupbringing or a bad neighborhood). White terrorists are typically interpreted as hapless victims of circum-\\nstance and as not acting in accordance with their “real”selves. Across many cases, in a North American\\ncontext, being a white man can, and often does, undermine one ’s classification as a terrorist —even\\nwhen one has committed blatant terrorist acts. See Kunst, Myhren, and Onyeador 2018 for further discus-\\nsion. This relates to what psychologists have called the “fundamental attribution error. ”For further discus-\\nsion see, for example, Sarah-Jane Leslie ’s work on generics and essentialization (Leslie 2017 ).\\n15Cf. Haslanger 2020b , who draws upon Yalcin 2016 , when defending the view that the content of a con-\\ncept is a partition of logical space. To possess a concept, in her view, is to have a disposition that responds to\\nthat partition in certain ways. However, one ’s ability to attend to the partition correctly (that is, to separate\\nthe X ’s from the non-X ’s) may vary depending upon a number of factors. Haslanger provides the following\\nillustrative case:\\nFor example, we may have the same concept of cat—the informational content of the concept catis\\nthe same for each of us —but our possession of it occurs in somewhat different ways so that certain\\ninferences are more direct for me than they are for you, or that I am more ready to apply the concept\\nthan you. Or it may be that because you know more about cats, you have a sensitivity to different\\nkinds of cat, so your partition of logical space is more fine-grained. (Haslanger 2020b , 240)\\nThis analysis helps to capture the idea that merely possessing or being competent with a concept is not, and\\nusually isn ’t, an indication that the individual can accurately apply the concept across all cases (that is, that\\nthey have a perfect ability to sort the X ’s from the non-X ’s).\\n16Cf. Endre Begby ’s analysis of evidential preemption in the context of testimonial exchange, especially\\nwhat he calls\\n“epistemic grooming ”(Begby 2020 ).\\n17Ishani Maitra outlines different ways in which concepts might be distorting using the concepts statutory\\nrape andsexual harassment as case studies (Maitra 2018 ). I hope to remain neutral on the ways in which\\nconcepts might be distorting; I believe that the phenomena in question are diverse and complex. Offering a\\ntaxonomy of the various ways in which concepts distort social reality is beyond the scope of this article;however, Maitra ’s work is helpful in outlining two potential ways this happens: through eliciting inappro-\\npriate inferences or eliciting inappropriate analogies. Also see Jenkins 2017 for a related and illuminating\\ndiscussion of the relationship between rape myths and hermeneutical injustice. Jenkins considers caseswhere a victim of rape is unable to understand her experience asrape owning to operative and distorting\\nrape myths.\\n18It is important to note that in some', doc_id='8b21a4fb-16c0-42b8-bd6f-c644b208f6c4', embedding=None, doc_hash='79a2a1c7f119595a1f753aaa12a42eaa0d4368fac0ff95e78b2661fcb44ac183', extra_info={'filename': '..\\\\..\\\\papers\\\\For_Imposter_Concept_Paper\\\\hermeneutical-injustice-distortion-and-conceptual-aptness.pdf'}, node_info={'start': 57990, 'end': 72524}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'e27d1a05-defb-4475-849a-5c6752c1b29a'}), score=0.8718824838329995), NodeWithScore(node=Node(text='ARTICLE\\nHermeneutical Injustice: Distortion and\\nConceptual Aptness\\nArianna Falbo\\nDepartment of Philosophy, Brown University, 45 Prospect Street, Providence, RI, 02912, USA\\nCorresponding author. arianna_falbo@brown.edu\\n(Received 8 March 2020; revised 2 January 2021; accepted 2 March 2021)\\nAbstract\\nThis article develops a new approach for theorizing about hermeneutical injustice.According to a dominant view, hermeneutical injustice results from a hermeneuticalgap: one lacks the conceptual tools needed to make sense of, or to communicate, impor-\\ntant social experiences, where this lack is a result of an injustice in the background socialmethods used to determine hermeneutical resources. I argue that this approach is incom-plete. It fails to capture an important species of hermeneutical injustice which doesn ’t\\nresult from a lack of hermeneutical resources, but from the overabundance of distorting\\nand oppressive concepts which function to crowd-out, defeat, or pre-empt the applicationof a more accurate hermeneutical resource. I propose a broader analysis that betterrespects the dynamic relationship between hermeneutical resources and the social andpolitical contexts in which they are implemented.\\nI. Introduction\\nScholarship on epistemic injustice has highlighted the importance of hermeneutical\\nresources in facilitating the intelligibility of socially significant experiences.1Notably,\\nMiranda Fricker has defended a species of epistemic harm that she calls hermeneutical\\ninjustice . On her analysis, hermeneutical injustice arises when one attempts to make a\\nsocially significant experience intelligible, but can ’t because one lacks the required her-\\nmeneutical tools (Fricker 2007 , 1). There is a gap in the inventory of hermeneutical\\nresources that are used to render important social experiences intelligible, where this\\ngap is the result of an injustice in the background social methods used to determine\\nhermeneutical resources (Fricker 2006 ;2007 ;2016 ;2017 ).\\nDespite various points of disagreement and further developments concerning\\nFricker ’s analysis, one key assumption appears to have gained widespread acceptance\\nin the literature. This is that hermeneutical injustice requires a lacuna in the stock of\\nhermeneutical resources used to interpret socially significant experiences.2The lacuna\\nrequirement imposes a necessary condition on the occurrence of a hermeneutical\\n© The Author(s), 2022.

A hermeneutical resource is absent from the hermeneutical repertoire, and\\nhad the needed concept been available —had this lacuna been filled —the injustice\\nwould no longer persist.3\\nIn what follows, I argue that a lacuna-centered approach to hermeneutical injustice is\\nincomplete. The lacuna requirement entails an overly narrow analysis of hermeneutical\\ninjustice and, as a result, it fails to capture an important species of hermeneutical injustice\\nthat merits more careful investigation. In particular, this approach fails to recognize a spe-cies of hermeneutical injustice that doesn ’t result from a dearth of hermeneutical\\nresources, but from the overabundance of distorting and oppressive concepts that func-\\ntion to crowd out, defeat, or preempt the application of an available and more accurate\\nconcept. Focusing on cases of hermeneutical injustice without hermeneutical lacunae\\nhelps to make salient important social dimensions of this epistemic injustice. It highlights\\nthe need for not only for novel hermeneutical resources —that is, the need to fill in her-\\nmeneutical gaps —but also the importance of acknowledging how those same resources\\nare integrated into extant conceptual frameworks within an overarching social milieu.\\nIn the next section, I develop the lacuna-centered approach in more detail. Following,\\nin section III, I argue that, in addition to facilitating intelligibility, hermeneutical resources\\nalso serve crucial productive functions —they organize and coordinate individuals within a\\nsocial milieu. In light of this, in section IV, I defend cases of hermeneutical injustice that\\ndon’t arise from a conceptual lack. In section V, I develop a broader framework for the-\\norizing about hermeneutical injustice and highlight its advantages. This framework rec-\\nognizes two distinct species of hermeneutical injustice: what I call positive andnegative\\nhermeneutical injustice.\\n4I end by sketching an approach to hermeneutical justice that\\nnaturally flows out of this more expansive framework.\\nII. The Lacuna-Centered Analysis\\nFricker draws our attention to the emergence of the concept sexual harassment in the\\nearly 1970s. She details the case of Carmita Wood, who quit her job at Cornell\\nUniversity ’s Nuclear Physics Department after experiencing persistent and unwanted\\nsexual advances from her boss. He would “jiggle his crotch ”while passing her desk\\nand would “deliberately brush against her breasts while reaching for some papers ”\\n(Fricker 2007 , 150).5When applying for unemployment insurance, Wood was required\\nto explain why she had quit, but she found herself at a loss for words. It wasn ’t shame-\\nless flirting or mere office humor that caused her to leave; what she experienced was\\nflat-out sexual harassment. But, since this concept had yet to make its way into collec-\\ntive understanding —let alone onto unemployment insurance forms —Wood couldn ’t\\narticulate her experience as such. She reported that she had quit for “personal reasons ”\\nand was subsequently denied insurance.\\nFricker describes Wood ’s case as a paradigmatic instance of hermeneutical injustice.\\nShe says: “Here is a story about how extant collective hermeneutical resources can have\\na lacuna where the name of a distinctive social experience should be ”(150 –51).\\nAccordingly, the hermeneutical injustice Wood faced resulted from a gap in the avail-able stock of hermeneutical resources; there was a lacuna where the concept sexual\\nharassment should have been. Moreover, this lacuna is a consequence of an injustice\\nin the background social methods that are used to determine hermeneutical resources.\\nIn Fricker ’s terminology, women like Wood faced hermeneutical marginalization : they\\nwere not equitably included in the political and legal contexts that serve to define the\\nconditions for unemployment.344 Arianna Falbo\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\nAccording to this approach, the primary harm of hermeneutical injustice concerns a\\nlack of intelligibility resulting from one ’s hermeneutical marginalization. Fricker says:\\n“the subject is rendered unable to make communicatively intelligible something\\nwhich it is particularly in his or her interests to be able to render intelligible ”(162).\\nThe secondary harms of hermeneutical injustice, Fricker argues, concern the down-\\nstream negative consequences that result from this unintelligibility. In Wood ’s case,\\nthis includes, among other things, her being denied unemployment insurance as wellas her increased levels of stress and anxiety.\\nT h ec a s eo fC a r m i t aW o o da n dt h ee m e r g e n c eo ft h ec o n c e p t sexual harassment\\nhas now become the stock example of hermeneutical injustice in the literature, but\\nit’s important to highlight that this injustice, as it ’s understood on a lacuna-\\ncentered model, can be illustrated using many other examples. Consider the recent\\nemergence of the concept genderqueer as a hermeneutical resource for understand-\\ning and giving recognition to the identities of nonbinary people. Robin Dembroff\\nargues that:\\nwithout the resources for understanding nonbinary gender identities, we sustain a\\nconceptual lacuna surrounding nonbinary persons. This lacuna does not only\\nreflect a gap in philosophical understanding: it contributes to a hermeneutical\\ninjustice that arises from the failure to spread and charitably analyze the concepts\\nand practices underlying nonbinary classifications. (Dembroff 2020 , 2, italics\\nadded)\\nAnother example is the concept of disability pride as it emerged in the disability\\nrights movement in the 1960s. Elizabeth Barnes has discussed the importance of this\\nconcept in challenging dominant associations of disability with tragedy, inferiority,\\nand shame. Barnes says: “As disabled people, we are forever being told that there is\\nsomething about our bodies that is lacking, that is less than . Disability pride says it\\ndoesn ’t have to be that way. Disability pride says that we may have minority bodies,\\nbut we don ’th a v e —we refuse to have —tragic bodies ”(Barnes 2016 , 186). For disabled\\nand nondisabled people alike, Barnes argues that the concept of disability pride has\\nhelped to make intelligible that disability can be the subject of genuine pride.\\nRecent scholarship has also highlighted significant limitations of Fricker ’s analysis\\nand has further expanded upon it. Gaile Pohlhaus develops the valuable notion of will-\\nful hermeneutical ignorance , which occurs when dominantly situated individuals refuse\\nto adopt the hermeneutical resources of marginalized groups (Pohlhaus 2012 ). Willful\\nhermeneutical ignorance functions to maintain hermeneutical gaps at the intercommu-\\nnal level —that is, though such resources may be utilized, even widely, among members\\nof one ’s own community or social group (that is, they are intra communally available),\\nlacunae nevertheless persist at the level of the dominant or collective hermeneutical rep-\\nertoire, which is used to interpret and communicate one ’s experiences across social\\ngroups more broadly.\\n6\\nBuilding upon the work of Pohlhaus and others, Kristie Dotson has developed an\\nanalysis of contributory injustice . This is an epistemic injustice resulting from willful\\nhermeneutical ignorance, which occurs when dominantly situated individuals choose\\nto employ prejudiced hermeneutical resources when they could have used more accu-\\nrate resources that have already been developed by those in marginalized communities\\n(Dotson 2012 ). Contributory injustice concerns the refusal among those in dominant\\npositions to allow marginalized individuals to exercise their epistemic agency byHypatia 345\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\ncontributing to the dominant hermeneutical repertoire. As a result, hermeneutical gaps\\npersist within the dominant (or intercommunal) hermeneutical inventory.\\nRelatedly, Luvell Anderson has analyzed how hermeneutical gaps may be actively\\ncultivated through the suppression of extant hermeneutical resources. Anderson gives\\nthe example of postracial movements aimed at eradicating and “moving beyond\\nrace”(Anderson 2017 ). Attempts to promote color-blind politics, he argues, function\\nto erase the concept race and the indispensable role it plays in understanding the expe-\\nriences of people of color (145 –46). Anderson thus enriches the lacuna-centered\\napproach to hermeneutical injustice by illustrating how some lacunae are actively cre-\\nated by the removal of available hermeneutical resources.\\nA common thread that unites these otherwise distinct analyses is an adherence to a\\nlacuna-centered framework for theorizing about hermeneutical injustice. Although\\nAnderson highlights a different way for hermeneutical gaps to emerge, lacunae feature\\nprominently in his analysis. And though Dotson and Pohlhaus articulate how needed\\nhermeneutical resources may be available and utilized within marginalized communi-\\nties, they highlight how lacunae may persist more broadly, within the stock of dominantor collective conceptual resources used to communicate across social groups. Hence,\\nhere too we find a similar background assumption, namely, the lacuna requirement.\\nA lacuna-centered approach has also influenced prominent conceptions of herme-\\nneutical justice. Fricker discusses the overcoming of hermeneutical injustice in the\\ncase of Wendy Sanford, a woman who suffered from postnatal depression after the\\nbirth of her child in the 1960s, prior to the emergence of the concept postnatal depres-\\nsion. She describes Sanford ’s experience during a consciousness-raising session:\\nWendy Sanford ’s moment of truth seems to be not simply a hermeneutical break-\\nthrough for her and for the other women present, but also a moment in which\\nsome kind of epistemic injustice is overcome . . . . If we can substantiate this intui-\\ntion, then we shall see that the area of hermeneutical gloom with which she had\\nlived up until that life-changing forty-five minutes constituted a wrong done to her\\nin her capacity as a knower, and was thus a specific sort of epistemic injustice —a\\nhermeneutical injustice. (Fricker 2007 , 149, italics added)\\nInfluenced by a lacuna-centered model, great importance is routinely placed upon\\nthe initial naming and subsequent intelligibility that hermeneutical resources help to\\nfacilitate (cf. McKinnon 2016 , 441; Davis 2018 , 720). If hermeneutical injustice results\\nfrom lacunae, the thought goes, then hermeneutical justice naturally calls for herme-\\nneutical \"plugs\", as it were, concepts that function to fill in the gaps.\\nTo summarize: a lacuna-centered framework proposes that hermeneutical injustice\\nstems from one ’s inability to make a significant social experience intelligible (to oneself\\nor to others) owing to a gap in the stock of hermeneutical resources, where this gap is a\\nresult of hermeneutical marginalization. According to this approach, hermeneuticalinjustice is perpetuated by the persistence and/or cultivation of hermeneutical lacu-\\nnae—had such lacunae been filled (intra and intercommunally), hermeneutical injustice\\nwould be overcome.\\nAlthough a lacuna-centered framework for theorizing about hermeneutical injustice\\nhas been widely adopted and endorsed across much of the recent literature, I will now\\nargue that it ’s incomplete and that a more expansive framework is needed. The lacuna-\\ncentered model is overly narrow and, as a result, it fails to capture an important species\\nof hermeneutical injustice that doesn ’t arise from a', doc_id='cca0295e-639a-433b-a537-df88136a6d22', embedding=None, doc_hash='40112cc1c1578277593032f8f3a901c3409e7d691774831b1f06fafcabfa88ed', extra_info={'filename': '..\\\\..\\\\papers\\\\For_Imposter_Concept_Paper\\\\hermeneutical-injustice-distortion-and-conceptual-aptness.pdf'}, node_info={'start': 0, 'end': 14478}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'e27d1a05-defb-4475-849a-5c6752c1b29a'}), score=0.8699513267329656)], extra_info=None)"

The overarching\\nmission of this movement is to combat mainstream narratives that promote unhealthy\\nand downright unattainable standards of beauty, body image, and health, targeting pri-marily young women and girls. By centering bodies that are marginalized in main-\\nstream media —disabled bodies, fat bodies, and bodies of color —and with slogans\\nlike “‘Fat’is not a bad word ”(Shackelford 2019 ) and artists like Cinta Tort Cartró\\nwho embraces the beauty of stretch marks by painting them vibrant colors (Park\\n2017 ), this movement aims to problematize dominant social assumptions and narratives\\nthat deem fatness and other marginalized body features to be a cause for embarrass-\\nment, shame, or inferiority.\\n20\\nCombating hermeneutical injustice is thus not simply a matter of filling in\\nhermeneutical gaps. Hermeneutical justice demands something much more radical andfar-reaching. More plausibly, it demands large-scale social movements aimed at disman-\\ntling oppressive ideologies and social practices. Without question, part of this will involve\\ncultivating and propagating novel conceptual resources —for example, concepts like gen-\\nderqueer, disability pride, body positivity, andsexual harassment —that is, it will require\\nfilling in hermeneutical lacunae. But, as we ’ve seen, much more is needed beyond this\\nto sufficiently guard against and overcome the harms of hermeneutical injustice.Hypatia 357\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\nSo, where does this leave us? In closing, I want to emphasize what I take to be the\\nbest way forward in theorizing about hermeneutical injustice and epistemic injustice\\nmore broadly. The main thrust is this: we need to broaden our horizons and engage\\nin a more socially embedded way.21Contrasting cases of positive and negative herme-\\nneutical injustice serves to illustrate how concepts don ’t exist and operate independently\\nfrom each other, but are deeply interconnected. The productive value of hermeneutical\\ntools is both constrained and enabled by their place alongside other concepts within anoverarching social milieu. Moreover, the sheer fact that many concepts were and still are\\nneeded to make sense of the socially significant experiences of marginalized communi-\\nties should be extremely suggestive of the current state of collective hermeneutical\\nframeworks and the strong influence of unjust social practices and oppressive concepts\\nand controlling images therein.\\nIt is thus imperative that we pay close attention to how concepts can function to\\nsustain and promote pernicious background ideologies and unjust social arrangements,\\nand how this in turn can restrict the productive function and power of liberatory\\nconcepts, both old and new. The intelligibility gained from the introduction andwidespread dissemination of a hermeneutical resource is undeniably important.\\nHowever, this is just one dimension of hermeneutical progress that ought not distract\\nus from others. We must also recognize the productive function and value of\\nhermeneutical resources and how they come to be deemed applicable and utilized, or\\nmore important, notapplicable and notutilized, across diverse social environments.\\nSuccessfully overcoming hermeneutical injustice likely requires full-fledged social\\nmovements —it requires organization, mobilization, and activism. It requires challeng-\\ning and disrupting the status quo narrative and dislodging ingrained assumptions\\nand ideologies that normalize and purport to justify oppressive social arrangements.Introducing into the collective hermeneutical repertoire a hermeneutical resource that\\nis needed to understand the experiences of disadvantaged groups is clearly a move in\\nthe right direction —it is progress toward hermeneutical justice. However, if prevailing\\nsocial conditions aren ’t conducive to the concept ’s gaining a meaningful grip on the\\nworld —that is, to its being broadly applied in important social contexts where it accu-\\nrately describes social reality and where it stands to do productive work to help improve\\nthe material conditions of those in marginalized communities —the concept ’s potential\\nto combat hermeneutical injustice will be undermined. Contrary to what a lacuna-\\ncentered analysis suggests, filling in hermeneutical gaps is not enough to ensure herme-\\nneutical justice; it is just one part of a much broader, comprehensive, and socially\\nembedded process.\\nAcknowledgments.

For simplicity, and following much of the literature, I will talk mostly in terms of conceptual\\nresources.358 Arianna Falbo\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\n2This requirement is argued for in Fricker 2006 ;2007 ;2016 ; and 2017. Although much of Fricker ’s orig-\\ninal 2007 discussion frames hermeneutical injustice as centrally involving hermeneutical lacunae, it ’s nota-\\nble that she includes the example of Edmund White ’sA Boy ’s Own Story (White 1983 ). This is a\\nsemi-autobiographical novel that describe White ’s experiences in the 1950s as a gay young man battling\\ndominant stereotypes of homosexuality as unnatural or as a sickness. Thus, Fricker ’s discussion of herme-\\nneutical injustice is sensitive to how oppressive stereotypes —and not just conceptual gaps —can influence\\nhermeneutical injustice, yet she remains focused largely upon lacunae throughout her discussion (see, espe-\\ncially, Fricker 2007 , 161 –62, as well as the initial definition of hermeneutical injustice given at the start of\\nher book: “hermeneutical injustice occurs . . . when a gap in collective resources puts someone at an unfair\\ndisadvantage when it comes to making sense of their social experiences ”[1]).\\n3This requirement for hermeneutical injustice is adopted widely across recent literature. See, for example,\\nBeeby 2011 ; Medina 2011 ,2012 ; Dotson 2012 ; Dotson 2014 ; Anderson 2017 ; Goetze 2017 ; Medina 2017 ;\\nToole 2019 ; Vasilyeva and Ayala-López 2019 ; Beverley 2020 ; Dembroff 2020 ; Dembroff and Whitcomb\\nforthcoming .\\n4Thank you to an anonymous referee for suggesting this terminology.\\n5Fricker draws from Susan Brownmiller ’s memoir of the Women ’s Liberation Movement in the 1960s\\nwhen discussing the case of Carmita Wood (Brownmiller 1990 ). For other early uses of the concept sexual\\nharassment , see Rowe 1974 ; Nemy 1975 .\\n6Criticisms of Fricker ’s analysis of hermeneutical injustice have pointed out a failure to distinguish\\nbetween intra and intercommunal dissemination of hermeneutical resources. See, for example, Mason\\n2011 ; Medina 2012 ; 2013. It is worth noting that even the inter/intracommunal dissemination distinction\\nis fairly idealized. The boundaries here are likley not as crisp as this distinction might suggest. For a relateddiscussion, also see Ashley Atkins ’s distinction between resistant understanding and dominant or collective\\nunderstanding (Atkins 2018 ).\\n7In developing her analysis of controlling images, Collins cites the work of Mae King and Cheryl Gilkes\\n(King 1973 ; Gilkes 1981 ). In discussing the work of these two scholars, Collins notes:\\nKing suggests that stereotypes represent externally-defined, controlling images of Afro-American\\nwomanhood that have been central to the dehumanization of Black women and the exploitation\\nof Black women ’s labor. Gilkes points out that Black women ’s assertiveness in resisting the multifac-\\neted oppression they experience has been a consistent threat to the status quo. As punishment, Black\\nwomen have been assaulted with a variety of externally-defined negative images designed to controlassertive Black female behavior. The value of King ’s and Gilkes ’analyses lies in their emphasis on the\\nfunction of stereotypes in controlling dominated groups. (Collins 1986 , 17, italics added)\\n8Note: as was mentioned previously, this does not necessarily mean that Black women are unable to\\ndevelop and use hermeneutic resources intra communally.\\n9We can also compare similar influential rhetoric during World War II that described Jewish people as\\n“vermin. ”For example, this language is prevalent in The Eternal Jew , a 1940 Nazi propaganda film. For\\nfurther discussions on the productive function of pernicious social concepts see, for example, Young\\n1990 , chapter 2, on cultural imperialism, Kukla 2018 on the relationship between slurs and ideology,\\nand Neufeld 2019 on slurs and essentialization.\\n10It is also important to note that “monstrosity ”and “animality ”are also deeply racialized notions in a\\nUnited States context, associated primarily with Black people and people of color. Consider, for example,\\nthe rhetoric surrounding the 1989 “Central Park Five ”case where five Black teenagers were wrongfully\\naccused of raping a white woman who was jogging in Central Park. These boys were described as a\\n“wolf pack, ”“animals, ”“bloodthirsty, ”“savages, ”and “wilding ”(Hinton 2019 ).\\n11At the time of the trial, the victim ’s name was kept anonymous and listed under “Emily Doe. ”However,\\nChanel Miller has recently shared her story with the broader public in a memoir: Know My Name (Miller\\n2019\\n).\\n12Manne ’s discussion of the Brock Turner case engages primarily with Fricker ’s account of testimonial\\ninjustice, a kind of epistemic injustice wherein a testifier ’s report fails to gain uptake owing to an identity\\nprejudice that the testimonial recipient has against the testifier. It ’s noteworthy that Fricker focuses primar-\\nily upon credibility deficits when developing her analysis of testimonial injustice (that is, giving too littleHypatia 359\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\ncredit to a testifier because of an identity prejudice that one has against them) (Fricker 2007 ). However,\\nrecent scholarship has persuasively argued that credibility surpluses —giving a testifier too much credit\\nowing to some prejudice —can also perpetuate testimonial injustice. See Medina 2012; Davis 2016 ;Y a p\\n2017 ; and Lackey 2018 ;2020 for further defenses of this point.\\n13Parts of this passage are quoted and discussed in Manne 2020 , 38. See Manne 2020 , chapter 3, for an\\ninsightful further discussion of this case.\\n14Another telling example concerns how Muslim men who commit violent acts against civilians are rou-\\ntinely labeled terrorists across United States media channels. But, when non-Muslim, white men commit\\nnearly identical acts, their behavior is routinely attributed to nonessential features of their psychology(for example, mental illness) or exogenous features of their environment (for example, poor childhood\\nupbringing or a bad neighborhood). White terrorists are typically interpreted as hapless victims of circum-\\nstance and as not acting in accordance with their “real”selves. Across many cases, in a North American\\ncontext, being a white man can, and often does, undermine one ’s classification as a terrorist —even\\nwhen one has committed blatant terrorist acts. See Kunst, Myhren, and Onyeador 2018 for further discus-\\nsion. This relates to what psychologists have called the “fundamental attribution error. ”For further discus-\\nsion see, for example, Sarah-Jane Leslie ’s work on generics and essentialization (Leslie 2017 ).\\n15Cf. Haslanger 2020b , who draws upon Yalcin 2016 , when defending the view that the content of a con-\\ncept is a partition of logical space. To possess a concept, in her view, is to have a disposition that responds to\\nthat partition in certain ways. However, one ’s ability to attend to the partition correctly (that is, to separate\\nthe X ’s from the non-X ’s) may vary depending upon a number of factors. Haslanger provides the following\\nillustrative case:\\nFor example, we may have the same concept of cat—the informational content of the concept catis\\nthe same for each of us —but our possession of it occurs in somewhat different ways so that certain\\ninferences are more direct for me than they are for you, or that I am more ready to apply the concept\\nthan you. Or it may be that because you know more about cats, you have a sensitivity to different\\nkinds of cat, so your partition of logical space is more fine-grained. (Haslanger 2020b , 240)\\nThis analysis helps to capture the idea that merely possessing or being competent with a concept is not, and\\nusually isn ’t, an indication that the individual can accurately apply the concept across all cases (that is, that\\nthey have a perfect ability to sort the X ’s from the non-X ’s).\\n16Cf. Endre Begby ’s analysis of evidential preemption in the context of testimonial exchange, especially\\nwhat he calls\\n“epistemic grooming ”(Begby 2020 ).\\n17Ishani Maitra outlines different ways in which concepts might be distorting using the concepts statutory\\nrape andsexual harassment as case studies (Maitra 2018 ). I hope to remain neutral on the ways in which\\nconcepts might be distorting; I believe that the phenomena in question are diverse and complex. Offering a\\ntaxonomy of the various ways in which concepts distort social reality is beyond the scope of this article;however, Maitra ’s work is helpful in outlining two potential ways this happens: through eliciting inappro-\\npriate inferences or eliciting inappropriate analogies. Also see Jenkins 2017 for a related and illuminating\\ndiscussion of the relationship between rape myths and hermeneutical injustice. Jenkins considers caseswhere a victim of rape is unable to understand her experience asrape owning to operative and distorting\\nrape myths.\\n18It is important to note that in some', doc_id='8b21a4fb-16c0-42b8-bd6f-c644b208f6c4', embedding=None, doc_hash='79a2a1c7f119595a1f753aaa12a42eaa0d4368fac0ff95e78b2661fcb44ac183', extra_info={'filename': '..\\\\..\\\\papers\\\\For_Imposter_Concept_Paper\\\\hermeneutical-injustice-distortion-and-conceptual-aptness.pdf'}, node_info={'start': 57990, 'end': 72524}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'e27d1a05-defb-4475-849a-5c6752c1b29a'}), score=0.8718824838329995),\n",

I argue that this approach is incom-plete. It fails to capture an important species of hermeneutical injustice which doesn ’t\\nresult from a lack of hermeneutical resources, but from the overabundance of distorting\\nand oppressive concepts which function to crowd-out, defeat, or pre-empt the applicationof a more accurate hermeneutical resource. I propose a broader analysis that betterrespects the dynamic relationship between hermeneutical resources and the social andpolitical contexts in which they are implemented.\\nI. Introduction\\nScholarship on epistemic injustice has highlighted the importance of hermeneutical\\nresources in facilitating the intelligibility of socially significant experiences.1Notably,\\nMiranda Fricker has defended a species of epistemic harm that she calls hermeneutical\\ninjustice . On her analysis, hermeneutical injustice arises when one attempts to make a\\nsocially significant experience intelligible, but can ’t because one lacks the required her-\\nmeneutical tools (Fricker 2007 , 1). There is a gap in the inventory of hermeneutical\\nresources that are used to render important social experiences intelligible, where this\\ngap is the result of an injustice in the background social methods used to determine\\nhermeneutical resources (Fricker 2006 ;2007 ;2016 ;2017 ).\\nDespite various points of disagreement and further developments concerning\\nFricker ’s analysis, one key assumption appears to have gained widespread acceptance\\nin the literature. This is that hermeneutical injustice requires a lacuna in the stock of\\nhermeneutical resources used to interpret socially significant experiences.2The lacuna\\nrequirement imposes a necessary condition on the occurrence of a hermeneutical\\n© The Author(s), 2022.

A hermeneutical resource is absent from the hermeneutical repertoire, and\\nhad the needed concept been available —had this lacuna been filled —the injustice\\nwould no longer persist.3\\nIn what follows, I argue that a lacuna-centered approach to hermeneutical injustice is\\nincomplete. The lacuna requirement entails an overly narrow analysis of hermeneutical\\ninjustice and, as a result, it fails to capture an important species of hermeneutical injustice\\nthat merits more careful investigation. In particular, this approach fails to recognize a spe-cies of hermeneutical injustice that doesn ’t result from a dearth of hermeneutical\\nresources, but from the overabundance of distorting and oppressive concepts that func-\\ntion to crowd out, defeat, or preempt the application of an available and more accurate\\nconcept. Focusing on cases of hermeneutical injustice without hermeneutical lacunae\\nhelps to make salient important social dimensions of this epistemic injustice. It highlights\\nthe need for not only for novel hermeneutical resources —that is, the need to fill in her-\\nmeneutical gaps —but also the importance of acknowledging how those same resources\\nare integrated into extant conceptual frameworks within an overarching social milieu.\\nIn the next section, I develop the lacuna-centered approach in more detail. Following,\\nin section III, I argue that, in addition to facilitating intelligibility, hermeneutical resources\\nalso serve crucial productive functions —they organize and coordinate individuals within a\\nsocial milieu. In light of this, in section IV, I defend cases of hermeneutical injustice that\\ndon’t arise from a conceptual lack. In section V, I develop a broader framework for the-\\norizing about hermeneutical injustice and highlight its advantages. This framework rec-\\nognizes two distinct species of hermeneutical injustice: what I call positive andnegative\\nhermeneutical injustice.\\n4I end by sketching an approach to hermeneutical justice that\\nnaturally flows out of this more expansive framework.\\nII. The Lacuna-Centered Analysis\\nFricker draws our attention to the emergence of the concept sexual harassment in the\\nearly 1970s. She details the case of Carmita Wood, who quit her job at Cornell\\nUniversity ’s Nuclear Physics Department after experiencing persistent and unwanted\\nsexual advances from her boss. He would “jiggle his crotch ”while passing her desk\\nand would “deliberately brush against her breasts while reaching for some papers ”\\n(Fricker 2007 , 150).5When applying for unemployment insurance, Wood was required\\nto explain why she had quit, but she found herself at a loss for words. It wasn ’t shame-\\nless flirting or mere office humor that caused her to leave; what she experienced was\\nflat-out sexual harassment. But, since this concept had yet to make its way into collec-\\ntive understanding —let alone onto unemployment insurance forms —Wood couldn ’t\\narticulate her experience as such. She reported that she had quit for “personal reasons ”\\nand was subsequently denied insurance.\\nFricker describes Wood ’s case as a paradigmatic instance of hermeneutical injustice.\\nShe says: “Here is a story about how extant collective hermeneutical resources can have\\na lacuna where the name of a distinctive social experience should be ”(150 –51).\\nAccordingly, the hermeneutical injustice Wood faced resulted from a gap in the avail-able stock of hermeneutical resources; there was a lacuna where the concept sexual\\nharassment should have been. Moreover, this lacuna is a consequence of an injustice\\nin the background social methods that are used to determine hermeneutical resources.\\nIn Fricker ’s terminology, women like Wood faced hermeneutical marginalization : they\\nwere not equitably included in the political and legal contexts that serve to define the\\nconditions for unemployment.344 Arianna Falbo\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\nAccording to this approach, the primary harm of hermeneutical injustice concerns a\\nlack of intelligibility resulting from one ’s hermeneutical marginalization. Fricker says:\\n“the subject is rendered unable to make communicatively intelligible something\\nwhich it is particularly in his or her interests to be able to render intelligible ”(162).\\nThe secondary harms of hermeneutical injustice, Fricker argues, concern the down-\\nstream negative consequences that result from this unintelligibility. In Wood ’s case,\\nthis includes, among other things, her being denied unemployment insurance as wellas her increased levels of stress and anxiety.\\nT h ec a s eo fC a r m i t aW o o da n dt h ee m e r g e n c eo ft h ec o n c e p t sexual harassment\\nhas now become the stock example of hermeneutical injustice in the literature, but\\nit’s important to highlight that this injustice, as it ’s understood on a lacuna-\\ncentered model, can be illustrated using many other examples. Consider the recent\\nemergence of the concept genderqueer as a hermeneutical resource for understand-\\ning and giving recognition to the identities of nonbinary people. Robin Dembroff\\nargues that:\\nwithout the resources for understanding nonbinary gender identities, we sustain a\\nconceptual lacuna surrounding nonbinary persons. This lacuna does not only\\nreflect a gap in philosophical understanding: it contributes to a hermeneutical\\ninjustice that arises from the failure to spread and charitably analyze the concepts\\nand practices underlying nonbinary classifications. (Dembroff 2020 , 2, italics\\nadded)\\nAnother example is the concept of disability pride as it emerged in the disability\\nrights movement in the 1960s. Elizabeth Barnes has discussed the importance of this\\nconcept in challenging dominant associations of disability with tragedy, inferiority,\\nand shame. Barnes says: “As disabled people, we are forever being told that there is\\nsomething about our bodies that is lacking, that is less than . Disability pride says it\\ndoesn ’t have to be that way. Disability pride says that we may have minority bodies,\\nbut we don ’th a v e —we refuse to have —tragic bodies ”(Barnes 2016 , 186). For disabled\\nand nondisabled people alike, Barnes argues that the concept of disability pride has\\nhelped to make intelligible that disability can be the subject of genuine pride.\\nRecent scholarship has also highlighted significant limitations of Fricker ’s analysis\\nand has further expanded upon it. Gaile Pohlhaus develops the valuable notion of will-\\nful hermeneutical ignorance , which occurs when dominantly situated individuals refuse\\nto adopt the hermeneutical resources of marginalized groups (Pohlhaus 2012 ). Willful\\nhermeneutical ignorance functions to maintain hermeneutical gaps at the intercommu-\\nnal level —that is, though such resources may be utilized, even widely, among members\\nof one ’s own community or social group (that is, they are intra communally available),\\nlacunae nevertheless persist at the level of the dominant or collective hermeneutical rep-\\nertoire, which is used to interpret and communicate one ’s experiences across social\\ngroups more broadly.\\n6\\nBuilding upon the work of Pohlhaus and others, Kristie Dotson has developed an\\nanalysis of contributory injustice . This is an epistemic injustice resulting from willful\\nhermeneutical ignorance, which occurs when dominantly situated individuals choose\\nto employ prejudiced hermeneutical resources when they could have used more accu-\\nrate resources that have already been developed by those in marginalized communities\\n(Dotson 2012 ). Contributory injustice concerns the refusal among those in dominant\\npositions to allow marginalized individuals to exercise their epistemic agency byHypatia 345\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/hyp.2022.4  Published online by Cambridge University Press\\ncontributing to the dominant hermeneutical repertoire. As a result, hermeneutical gaps\\npersist within the dominant (or intercommunal) hermeneutical inventory.\\nRelatedly, Luvell Anderson has analyzed how hermeneutical gaps may be actively\\ncultivated through the suppression of extant hermeneutical resources. Anderson gives\\nthe example of postracial movements aimed at eradicating and “moving beyond\\nrace”(Anderson 2017 ). Attempts to promote color-blind politics, he argues, function\\nto erase the concept race and the indispensable role it plays in understanding the expe-\\nriences of people of color (145 –46). Anderson thus enriches the lacuna-centered\\napproach to hermeneutical injustice by illustrating how some lacunae are actively cre-\\nated by the removal of available hermeneutical resources.\\nA common thread that unites these otherwise distinct analyses is an adherence to a\\nlacuna-centered framework for theorizing about hermeneutical injustice. Although\\nAnderson highlights a different way for hermeneutical gaps to emerge, lacunae feature\\nprominently in his analysis. And though Dotson and Pohlhaus articulate how needed\\nhermeneutical resources may be available and utilized within marginalized communi-\\nties, they highlight how lacunae may persist more broadly, within the stock of dominantor collective conceptual resources used to communicate across social groups. Hence,\\nhere too we find a similar background assumption, namely, the lacuna requirement.\\nA lacuna-centered approach has also influenced prominent conceptions of herme-\\nneutical justice. Fricker discusses the overcoming of hermeneutical injustice in the\\ncase of Wendy Sanford, a woman who suffered from postnatal depression after the\\nbirth of her child in the 1960s, prior to the emergence of the concept postnatal depres-\\nsion. She describes Sanford ’s experience during a consciousness-raising session:\\nWendy Sanford ’s moment of truth seems to be not simply a hermeneutical break-\\nthrough for her and for the other women present, but also a moment in which\\nsome kind of epistemic injustice is overcome . . . . If we can substantiate this intui-\\ntion, then we shall see that the area of hermeneutical gloom with which she had\\nlived up until that life-changing forty-five minutes constituted a wrong done to her\\nin her capacity as a knower, and was thus a specific sort of epistemic injustice —a\\nhermeneutical injustice. (Fricker 2007 , 149, italics added)\\nInfluenced by a lacuna-centered model, great importance is routinely placed upon\\nthe initial naming and subsequent intelligibility that hermeneutical resources help to\\nfacilitate (cf. McKinnon 2016 , 441; Davis 2018 , 720). If hermeneutical injustice results\\nfrom lacunae, the thought goes, then hermeneutical justice naturally calls for herme-\\nneutical \"plugs\", as it were, concepts that function to fill in the gaps.\\nTo summarize: a lacuna-centered framework proposes that hermeneutical injustice\\nstems from one ’s inability to make a significant social experience intelligible (to oneself\\nor to others) owing to a gap in the stock of hermeneutical resources, where this gap is a\\nresult of hermeneutical marginalization. According to this approach, hermeneuticalinjustice is perpetuated by the persistence and/or cultivation of hermeneutical lacu-\\nnae—had such lacunae been filled (intra and intercommunally), hermeneutical injustice\\nwould be overcome.\\nAlthough a lacuna-centered framework for theorizing about hermeneutical injustice\\nhas been widely adopted and endorsed across much of the recent literature, I will now\\nargue that it ’s incomplete and that a more expansive framework is needed. The lacuna-\\ncentered model is overly narrow and, as a result, it fails to capture an important species\\nof hermeneutical injustice that doesn ’t arise from a', doc_id='cca0295e-639a-433b-a537-df88136a6d22', embedding=None, doc_hash='40112cc1c1578277593032f8f3a901c3409e7d691774831b1f06fafcabfa88ed', extra_info={'filename': '..\\\\..\\\\papers\\\\For_Imposter_Concept_Paper\\\\hermeneutical-injustice-distortion-and-conceptual-aptness.pdf'}, node_info={'start': 0, 'end': 14478}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: 'e27d1a05-defb-4475-849a-5c6752c1b29a'}), score=0.8699513267329656)]"

    "    \"Answer: \"\n",
    "    \"Hermeneutical injustice is related to a phenomenon where the meaning of concepts are twisted and co-opted, eventually losing their meaning in that oppressive and distorting concepts can be used to crowd out, defeat, or preempt the accurate application of a concept. Examples of such oppressive concepts include the use of genocidal language games (Tirrell, 2012) and rape myths in the news media (O’Hara, 2012), which both have been used to distort the meaning of concepts and prevent the accurate application of those concepts. Positive hermeneutical injustice is thus connected to the presence of oppressive concepts that limit or block the accurate application of a concept, as well as the removal of available hermeneutical resources, such as postracial movements which attempt to erase the concept of race and thereby limit or block the accurate application of the concept (Paiella, 2016).\"\n",
    "    \"This can result in a failure of conceptual aptness or applicability, meaning that marginalized individuals are unable to contribute their knowledge in a socially significant context and their status as a knower is diminished (Pohlhaus, 2012; Toole, 2019). Combating hermeneutical injustice is therefore not just a matter of filling in hermeneutical gaps, but also involves large-scale social movements aimed at dismantling oppressive ideologies and scripts. Such movements are necessary in order to develop and widely disseminate novel concepts needed to understand socially significant experiences (Rowe, 1974; Taylor, 2018), as well as to unlearning and dislodging the distorting ideological grip of controlling images and oppressive concepts that are operative within one’s social milieu (Yap, 2017). Examples of such movements include the gay rights movement and the fight for marriage equality in North America (Eleonore, 2019), as well as the #BodyPositivity movement (Park, 2017; Shackelford, 2019), which have helped to support the intelligibility of concepts that have been twisted and co-opted, and have also enabled individuals to enjoy benefits and privileges afforded by legal unions (White, 1983; Xu, 2016).\"\n",

       "<b>The two sub-branches of discriminatory epistemic injustice discussed by the author are testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice. Testimonial injustice occurs when a speaker's credibility is devalued due to the hearer's prejudice, while hermeneutical injustice occurs when a subject who is already marginalized in terms of generating social meanings is put at a disadvantage when it comes to making sense of a significant area of their social experience. The author also discusses two specific forms of testimonial injustice, participatory prejudice and informational prejudice, which involve a person or group facing obstacles to their participation in collective epistemic activities. \n",
       "\n",
       "Ill persons are particularly vulnerable to these forms of epistemic injustice due to negative stereotypes and prejudices that are often associated with illness. These stereotypes and prejudices can be irrational and operate without any focused awareness, making it difficult for ill individuals to be taken seriously as knowers. Healthcare institutions are also underpinned by biomedical approaches that focus on the biological rather than existential aspects of illness, which can lower the level of attention paid to the subjective experience of being ill. Additionally, time pressure, short consultations, and use of standardized protocols can limit opportunities for personalized care and communication between patients and health professionals, further eroding the epistemic confidence and capacities of the ill person.\n",
       "\n",
       "Combating these forms of epistemic injustice requires a large-scale social movement aimed at dismantling oppressive ideologies and stereotypes. Such movements are necessary to develop and disseminate novel concepts needed to understand socially significant experiences and to unlearn and dislodge the grip of controlling images and oppressive concepts that are operative within one's social milieu. The gay rights movement and the fight for marriage equality in North America, as well as the #BodyPositivity movement, are examples of social movements that have supported the intelligibility of concepts that have been twisted and co-opted, and have enabled individuals to enjoy benefits and privileges afforded by legal unions.</b>"

       "[Response(response='Epistemic injustice, hermeneutical injustice, and linguistic hijacking are interrelated concepts that play a significant role in shaping the discourse on marginalized groups in society. Epistemic injustice refers to the ways in which individuals or groups are denied the capacity to participate as full and equal members in the social and intellectual practices of their community. Testimonial injustice and hermeneutical injustice are two forms of epistemic injustice that can arise in these contexts.\\n\\nTestimonial injustice occurs when a speaker is not given the benefit of the doubt and is not believed or taken seriously because of their social identity. Hermeneutical injustice, on the other hand, occurs when a speaker’s experience or perspective is not recognized or understood because there are no available hermeneutical resources for making sense of it. This can result in the speaker being silenced or not being able to contribute their knowledge in a socially significant context.\\n\\nLinguistic hijacking is a phenomenon in which concepts are twisted and co-opted, eventually losing their original meaning. It is related to epistemic and hermeneutical injustice in that oppressive and distorting concepts can be used to crowd out, defeat, or preempt the accurate application of a concept. This can result in a failure of conceptual aptness or applicability, meaning that marginalized individuals are unable to contribute their knowledge in a socially significant context and their status as a knower is diminished.\\n\\nHermeneutical injustice is also related to linguistic hijacking in that it can lead to the loss of meaning of concepts. Hermeneutical injustice occurs when a gap in collective hermeneutical resources puts a person or group at an unfair disadvantage when making sense of their social experiences. Specifically, \"some significant area of one\\'s social experience [is] obscured from collective understanding owing to a structural identity prejudice in the collective hermeneutical resource\" (Fricker, 2007). This can occur when dominant and non-dominant hermeneutical resources are not recognized or respected by the dominant social and epistemic authorities, resulting in a failure to adequately understand and articulate experiences.\\n\\nExamples of linguistic hijacking include the use of genocidal language games and rape myths in the news media, which both have been used to distort the meaning of concepts and prevent the accurate application of those concepts. Positive hermeneutical injustice is thus connected to the presence of oppressive concepts that limit or block the accurate application of a concept, as well as the removal of available hermeneutical resources, such as postracial movements which attempt to erase the concept of race and thereby limit or block the accurate application of the concept.\\n\\nTo combat linguistic hijacking and its related injustices, large-scale social movements are necessary to dismantle oppressive ideologies and scripts.

Hermeneutical Injustice\\nHermeneutical injustice occurs when a gap in collective hermeneutical resources puts\\na person or group at unfair disadvantage when making sense of their social experi-ences. Speci ﬁcally, ‘some signi ﬁcant area of one ’s social experience [is] obscured from\\ncollective understanding owing to a structural identity prejudice in the collective\\nhermeneutical resource ’.\\n45Certain experiences cannot be understood because of the\\nabsence of the resources needed to understand them, and then to articulate and com-municate that understanding to others, with the consequence that the person or groupsuffers hermeneutical marginalization , which Fricker de ﬁnes as ‘unequal hermeneutical\\nparticipation with respect to some signi ﬁcant area(s) of social experience ’.\\n46\\nThe social implications of hermeneutical marginalization arise because our ability to\\nrecognise and respond to the concerns and experiences of others is crucially premisedupon our ability to understand those concerns and experiences by mobilising adequate\\nhermeneutical resources. If the required resources do not exist, those experiences will\\nremain obscure in a way that prevents even the most sympathetic social peers torespond adequately to them. It is for this reason that hermeneutical injustice is struc-tural and not agential, arising from speci ﬁc contingent features of the social world –\\nsuch as its educational practices and political arrangements –rather than from the\\nactivities of speci ﬁc agents.

       " Response(response='Epistemic injustice, hermeneutical injustice, and linguistic hijacking are interconnected phenomena that contribute to the marginalization of certain groups in society. Epistemic injustice involves the systematic exclusion or devaluation of certain types of knowledge or perspectives, often based on race, gender, or other identity markers. Hermeneutical injustice occurs when a gap in collective hermeneutical resources puts a person or group at an unfair disadvantage when making sense of their social experiences. Linguistic hijacking exacerbates both epistemic and hermeneutical injustice by allowing dominant groups to co-opt and redefine terms in ways that further marginalize or silence marginalized groups.\\n\\nHermeneutical injustice is related to linguistic hijacking, as the co-opting of terms can lead to a distortion of the meaning of concepts and prevent the accurate application of those concepts. This can result in a failure of conceptual aptness or applicability, meaning that marginalized individuals are unable to contribute their knowledge in a socially significant context and their status as a knower is diminished. Furthermore, epistemic injustice can contribute to linguistic hijacking by allowing dominant groups to control the narrative and redefine terms in a way that supports their interests.\\n\\nTo combat both epistemic and hermeneutical injustice and linguistic hijacking, a multifaceted approach is required. This approach involves recognizing and challenging oppressive ideologies and scripts, developing and disseminating novel concepts, and supporting the voices and perspectives of marginalized groups. Such movements include the gay rights movement, the fight for marriage equality, and the #BodyPositivity movement. These movements have helped to support the intelligibility of concepts that have been twisted and co-opted, and have enabled individuals to enjoy benefits and privileges afforded by legal unions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, addressing the interconnected phenomena of epistemic injustice, hermeneutical injustice, and linguistic hijacking is crucial to promoting social justice and equality. This requires a large-scale social movement aimed at dismantling oppressive ideologies and scripts, as well as developing and disseminating novel concepts needed to understand socially significant experiences.', source_nodes=[NodeWithScore(node=Node(text='Human: How is epistemic injustice related to hermeneutical injustice?

Hermeneutical Injustice\\nHermeneutical injustice occurs when a gap in collective hermeneutical resources puts\\na person or group at unfair disadvantage when making sense of their social experi-ences. Speci ﬁcally, ‘some signi ﬁcant area of one ’s social experience [is] obscured from\\ncollective understanding owing to a structural identity prejudice in the collective\\nhermeneutical resource ’.\\n45Certain experiences cannot be understood because of the\\nabsence of the resources needed to understand them, and then to articulate and com-municate that understanding to others, with the consequence that the person or groupsuffers hermeneutical marginalization , which Fricker de ﬁnes as ‘unequal hermeneutical\\nparticipation with respect to some signi ﬁcant area(s) of social experience ’.\\n46\\nThe social implications of hermeneutical marginalization arise because our ability to\\nrecognise and respond to the concerns and experiences of others is crucially premisedupon our ability to understand those concerns and experiences by mobilising adequate\\nhermeneutical resources. If the required resources do not exist, those experiences will\\nremain obscure in a way that prevents even the most sympathetic social peers torespond adequately to them.

      "NodeWithScore(node=Node(text='for instance). What was less familiar was the idea\\nof discriminatory epistemic injustice: a branch of epistemic injustice which, I have\\nargued, divides into two sub-branches, namely testimonial injustice and hermeneuticalinjustice.\\n3Since I have discussed these phenomena in detail in other work, I will merely\\nput the two concepts swiftly in place here. Once this is done, I will be in a position to\\nproceed with the task of this paper: to make out a new connection between epistemicjustice and an ideal of political freedom, and to explore the implications for account-\\nable institutional practices. My hope is that elaborating these ideas will reveal just\\nhow tightly epistemic justice needs to be interwoven in the fabric of the liberal polity.\\n1I have argued for this point about philosophical method more fully in Fricker (2012 ).\\n2David Coady has rightly emphasized both these points; see Coady (2010 ).\\n3For a fuller account of these kinds of epistemic injustice, see Fricker (2007 ).\\n123\\nSynthese (2013) 190:1317–1332 1319\\nTestimonial injustice happens when a speaker receives a deﬁcit of credibility owing\\nto the operation of prejudice in the hearer’s judgement. A possible example might be in\\na case of ‘stop and search’ by the police, where a racial prejudice affects the perceptionof the police ofﬁcer so that a young black male driver receives a prejudicially deﬂated\\nlevel of credibility when he declares that he is the rightful owner of the car. There will\\nof course be a spectrum of cases spanning those in which the speaker’s credibility isonly marginally deﬂated to those where it is drastically deﬂated, and also spanning\\ncases where (whatever the deﬂation) it either is or isn’t sufﬁcient to bring the level of\\ncredibility below the threshold for hearer acceptance. Sometimes a speaker’s word istaken far less seriously than it would be absent the prejudice, yet they are still believed;\\nsometimes a small credibility deﬂation is enough to entail that the speaker’s word is\\nrejected.\\nHermeneutical injustice occurs at a stage prior to communicative activity, though\\nit will only surface in a certain kind of failed or semi-failed attempt to render anexperience intelligible, either to oneself or communicatively to another. This kind of\\nepistemic injustice happens when a subject who is already hermeneutically marginal-\\nized (that is, they belong to a group which does not have access to equal participationin the generation of social meanings) is thereby put at an unfair disadvantage when\\nit comes to making sense of a signiﬁcant area of their social experience. An example\\nmight be a woman who attacked or killed a long-term physically abusive partner at atime before the background history of his own violence and intimidation came to be\\ninterpretable by reference to the legal category of ‘provocation’.\\nLike testimonial injustice, hermeneutical injustice comes in different degrees of\\nseverity, and along more than one dimension. First, there is internal diversity as regards\\nthe degree of misunderstanding. At one extreme, even serious domestic violence might\\nonce have been culturally, quasi secretly, understood as the violent afﬁrmation of a\\nproper natural hierarchy between ‘man and wife’ (not forgetting that our rich capacity\\nfor incoherence in collective forms of understanding is such that this construal can\\nsubsist alongside another, more openly avowed, interpretation to the effect that such\\nviolence is appalling). Or, alternatively, a less radical failure of understanding might\\nbe illustrated by a situation where such violence is on the whole taken seriously as acriminal offence, yet still not properly dealt with by the relevant institutional bodies\\nowing to confused social meanings surrounding, for instance, the fact that the victim\\ndid not leave her violent partner.\\nSecond, hermeneutical injustice is internally diverse in relation to how widespread\\nthe failure of understanding is. At the extreme, there can be cases where even the\\nsubject herself is radically unable to make sense of her own experience; or, by contrast,there can be cases at the other extreme in which the subject herself is entirely clear\\nwhat is happening to her, and can perhaps expect to communicate her experience\\nwith ease to other members of her community or social group, but (owing to thecollective hermeneutical gap pertaining to the wider community as a whole) still\\ncannot expect to communicate it successfully to signiﬁcant social agencies—notably,\\nrelevant institutional bodies—in order to describe or protest the experience. Finally,a third dimension of internal diversity in hermeneutical injustice is that such unfair\\ndeﬁcits of intelligibility might be owing either to the inadequately conceptualised\\n123\\n1320 Synthese (2013) 190:1317–1332\\ncontent , and/or owing to an inadequately understood expressive form , in the sense of\\nstyle of communication.\\nI have tried in previous work to develop the ethical and epistemic aspects of the\\nwrong of both kinds of discriminatory epistemic injustice.4In brief, there is a generic\\nwrong to any kind of epistemic injustice (including the distributive kind) which is\\na matter of the subject being wronged speciﬁcally in their capacity as an epistemic\\nsubject . In respect of testimonial injustice, this generic wrong becomes somewhat\\nspeciﬁed in the idea of the subject’s being wronged as a giver of knowledge (an\\nunjust deﬁcit of credibility); and in respect of hermeneutical injustice it becomes theidea of the subject’s being wronged in their capacity for social understanding (an\\nunjust deﬁcit of', doc_id='d96b7738-3684-4c07-9989-8e77f9c166fc', embedding=None, doc_hash='9acf793d9f46ee6b6c52389060ecb1cabf74c565a6290f93bf3c8c60992c5cfd', extra_info={'filename': 'fricker2012.pdf'}, node_info={'start': 4901, 'end': 10477}, relationships={<DocumentRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: '57cd3171-c4af-4707-af47-3a33a4386d53'}), score=0.9140560927098698)\n",
